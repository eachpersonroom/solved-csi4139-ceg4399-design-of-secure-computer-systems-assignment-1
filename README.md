Find an attack on any system (may be a computer system or network, but need not be) that occurred during 2017 and/or 2018.  (<em>Note:  please do not use the Equifax breach that we discussed in class; find another attack instead.</em>) Write a 2-5 page report on this attack that includes the following information:




<ul>

 <li>A description of the system or systems on which this attack occurred.</li>

 <li>A description of the attack itself – what was the vulnerability that was exploited by the attacker?</li>

 <li>A description of the damage that was done by this attack (if any).</li>

 <li>A discussion of any mechanisms or procedures that could have been used by the owners or administrators of the system to prevent this attack from being successful (and discuss how feasible these would have been to implement).</li>

</ul>




Be sure to cite – using proper references in proper format – all sources of information used in your research (must be at least two).
